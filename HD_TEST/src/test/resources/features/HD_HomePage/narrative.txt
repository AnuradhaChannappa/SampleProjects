Search for suggestions
As a user I don't know what facilities are available on Health Direct
I want to be able to look up the available facilities
I should be able to get suggestions for valid search
And no suggestions for invalid suggestions
The suggestions containing searched keyword should be highlighted bold
I should be able to click on one of the suggestions
The search results should list details for the keyword searched
